### Changed

## [1.0.7] = 2022-12-5
Changed:
- Added StimulusType and STIMULUS_TYPE_NAME_MAPPING to stimulus ontology, replacing definitions in EphysDataset
- Updated data_set_features to use correct sweep feature extractor detection parameters based on StimulusType

## [1.0.6] = 2022-6-29

## [1.0.4] = 2021-07-29
Changed:
- selects recording rather than sweep epoch by default
- restructures epoch detection to use recording epoch for stim epoch detection
- Use NaNs instead of truncating

Bug fixes:
- Round the duration calculation in `run_feature_vector_extraction` so that
vectors of the same length are produced even when floating point approximations
of times are different.

## [1.0.3] = 2021-02-02
Changed:
- Adds new 'Stimulus contains NaN values' tag and error handling to qc_feature_extractor

Bug fixes:

Bug fixes:
- Fix segment length rounding error in the DAT file converter
